            <p> <strong>(a) Description</strong></p>
            <p>
                The course is to create a strong base in the principles and practice of functional programming. A high level programming
                language like C is to be used. Students are to cover both theoretical principles and hands on practical skills. The main concepts
                to cover include program structure, data structures, syntactical and semantic correctness, planning and segmentation in
                programming as well as working with files.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>(b) Aims</strong></p>
            <p>The aims of the course unit are to:</p>
            <ul>

                <li>
                    Comprehensive knowledge about structured oriented programming

                </li>
                <li>
                    Knowledge in planning and organization of programming projects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knowledge and techniques of evaluating syntactic and semantic correctness of a computer program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Strong practical basis in programming
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p> <strong>(c) Learning outcomes</strong></p>
            <p>By the end of the course unit, the student should be able to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Understand the basic terminology used in computer programming
                </li>
                <li>
                    Write, compile and debug programs in C language
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use different data types in a computer program
                </li>
                <li>
                    Design programs involving decision structures, loops and functions
                </li>
                <li>
                    Explain the difference between call by value and call by reference
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use different data structures and create/update basic data files
                </li>

            </ul>

            <p> <strong>(d) Teaching and learning pattern</strong></p>
            <p>
                The course will be taught with a big practical component. Students will be expected to have one supervised practical sessions
                per week. They will so be given several programming assignments some of which will be marked and contribute to the
                coursework scores.
