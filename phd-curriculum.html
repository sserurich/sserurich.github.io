                                <p><strong>(a)Course Description</strong></p>
                                <p>
                                        This course introduces foundational concepts and techniques of programming languages. We use
                                        typed λ-calculi and operational semantics as models of programming language concepts. These
                                        models are applicable to the design, analysis, and implementation of programming languages. We
                                        demonstrate the utility of a mathematical approach to programming languages in answering questions
                                        about program correctness, the pro’s and con’s of various languages, compiler correctness, and other
                                        practical issues. We focus on two of the most successful styles of semantic description: denotational
                                        and operational. We deal with small “core” languages, each chosen to illustrate a specific paradigm. We
                                        use semantics to prove properties of a language, to analyze programs, to design correct programs, to
                                        prove correctness of compiler optimizations, and to prove general laws of program equivalence.
                                    </p>
                                 <p><strong>(b)Aims</strong></p>
                                 <p>The objective is to:</p>
                                 <ul>
                                        <li>To study formal techniques for describing computation and compilation.</li>
                                        <li>Provide a more general understanding of programming languages, specification, logic,
                                        mathematics, and proof theory.</li>
                                        <li>Apply formal reasoning to nondeterministic programs and to concurrent programs, and provide
                                        an introduction to reasoning about distributed systems (temporal logic).</li>
                                 </ul>

                                 At the end of the course students will be able to: describe and relate different programming paradigms
                                 and the mathematical models on which they build; select appropriate methodology to use in the final
                                 research work and dissertation.

                                        Classes are held as a group discussion. Reading material which includes journal papers is distributed a
                                        week in advance, and students take it in turns to research and present new topics. The lecturer
                                        addresses questions to the students to encourage them to think about and understand the material.
                                        The lecturer should become aware of the students' proposed topics of research so that the discussion explores how the principles in the course apply to these topics. The students make presentations of
                                        their review paper for critique from both the students and the lecturer.

                <p><strong>(a)Description</strong></p>
                <p>
                        Most PhD students struggle with scientific writing and presentations in English, and normally much time
                        in a PhD study is spent revising papers and preparing for conference talks. Given the amount of time
                        that PhD students spend writing and preparing to present, students should invest in a systematic study
                        of scientific writing and presentations. The course deals with the publication process from the
                        perspectives of the author of a scientific paper and the editor of a scientific journal. It is intended for
                        PhD students in the fields of computing and Information technology, engineering and natural sciences.
                    </p>
                 <p><strong>(b)Aims and Objectives</strong></p>
                 <p>The aim is to give the participants the following</p>

                 <p> <strong>(c) Course Content:</strong></p>
                 <p>
                        CThe first part of the course is devoted to the philosophical underpinnings of
                        research, which crucially influence choice of research methods and interpretations of data. The
                        course then moves on to the more practical aspects of 'doing research' - looking at developing a
                        research strategy as well as ways of collecting data, analysing data and communicating research
                        findings. This course will also give guidance to students on how to identify a research problem.
                        Students will be presented with various research paradigms and models of methodology and
                        assisted with designing an appropriate method for their research. Students will be trained in the
                        analysis and presentation of results, exposition of processes and methods used and conclusions
                        drawn.
                        Key philosophical and epistemological bases for research are explored, and alternative
                        methodologies are examined in relation to varied theoretical approaches. Selected sets of methods
                        and techniques are critically appraised, while the range and scope of techniques with which students
                        are familiar is extended. The structure of the course aims to achieve a balance between theory and
                        practice. Considerable emphasis is therefore placed upon the logistics of setting-up, doing and
                        disseminating research. The course not only introduces a range of research ideas and skills central
                        to sound socio-environmental enquiry in general, but also acts as a critical and practical research
                        forum where discussion and preparation for the PhD dissertation takes place.

                     <p>
                            Classes are held as a group discussion. Reading material which includes journal papers is distributed a week in advance, and students take it in turns to research and
                            present new topics. The lecturer addresses questions to the students to encourage them to think
                            about and understand the material. Each student undertakes a review of the different research
                            methodologies and makes a presentation before the class. The students will identify researchable
                            problems from which they will apply the concepts taught in class with an aim of producing research
                            proposals by the end of the semester. The students will be required to build on their proposals on a
                            weekly basis in line with the new concepts that will be taught. The students will make presentations of
                            their draft proposal for critique and feedback from both the students and the lecturer.

                 <p>
                        The course will generally take the form of a reading group. Papers are selected in advance each week, and
                        students take it in turn to lead a discussion through that paper, explaining the methodology used and
                        identifying its strengths and weaknesses. The lecturer is on hand to
                        Moderate the discussion, to provide explanations of difficult material (e.g. mathematical techniques which
                        students are not familiar with) and to correct any misunderstandings which arise.
                        The course will also make use of video lectures available online (e.g. from www.videolectures.net, which is
                        particularly strong on machine learning material). Students should watch these videos of research
                        presentations or tutorials in their own time, and then the class meets to discuss and compare notes.

                            Scientific foundations for software engineering depend on the use of precise, abstract models for

                            standard models for representing sequential and concurrent systems, such as state machines,
                            algebras, and traces. It shows how different logics can be used to specify properties of software
                            systems, such as functional correctness, deadlock freedom, and internal consistency. Concepts such
                            as composition mechanisms, abstraction relations, invariants, non-determinism, inductive definitions
                            and denotational descriptions are recurrent themes throughout the course.

                        Classes are held as a group discussion. Reading material which includes journal papers is distributed a
                        week in advance, and students take it in turns to research and present new topics. The lecturer
                        addresses questions to the students to encourage them to think about and understand the material. The
                        lecturer should become aware of the students' proposed topics of research so that the discussion
                        explores how the principles in the course apply to these topics. The students make presentations
                        of their review paper for critique from both the students and the lecturer.

                 <p>
                        Assessment will be by take-home assignments leading to presentations and a scientific review paper.
                        Students will be given tasks to read and write about then present in class. The lecturer will award marks
                        for each write up of a scientific review paper.
